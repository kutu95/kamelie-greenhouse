# Orders Database Setup Instructions

## Overview
The order management system has been implemented with the following features:
- ✅ Cart clearing after successful order creation
- ✅ Order saving to database
- ✅ Admin Order Management page
- ✅ My Orders section in user profile
- ✅ API endpoints for order management

## Required Database Setup

To complete the setup, you need to create the database tables manually in your Supabase dashboard:

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**

### Step 2: Create Tables
Copy and paste the contents of `scripts/create-orders-table.sql` into the SQL Editor and execute it.

This will create:
- `orders` table - Main order information
- `order_items` table - Individual items in each order
- Proper indexes for performance
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Triggers for automatic timestamp updates

### Step 3: Verify Setup
After running the SQL script, you should see:
- Two new tables: `orders` and `order_items`
- RLS policies are enabled
- Proper foreign key relationships

## Features Implemented

### 1. Checkout Page Updates
- Orders are now saved to the database when completed
- Cart is automatically cleared after successful order creation
- Order data includes customer info, delivery method, payment details, and items

### 2. Admin Order Management (`/admin/orders`)
- View all orders with filtering and search
- Update order status and payment status
- Order details including customer info and items
- Real-time status updates

### 3. User Profile My Orders Section
- Display recent orders (last 5)
- Order status badges
- Payment method indicators
- Quick access to order details
- Link to start shopping if no orders exist

### 4. API Endpoints
- `GET /api/orders` - Fetch orders (user sees own, admin sees all)
- `POST /api/orders` - Create new order
- `GET /api/orders/[id]` - Get specific order details
- `PATCH /api/orders/[id]` - Update order (admin only)

## Order Status Flow
1. **Pending** - Order just created
2. **Confirmed** - Admin confirms the order
3. **Processing** - Order being prepared
4. **Ready for Pickup** - Order ready for customer pickup
5. **Delivered** - Order completed

## Payment Status Flow
1. **Pending** - Payment not yet processed
2. **Paid** - Payment confirmed
3. **Failed** - Payment failed
4. **Refunded** - Payment refunded

## Security
- Users can only view their own orders
- Admins can view and manage all orders
- RLS policies enforce proper access control
- API endpoints validate user permissions

## Next Steps
1. Run the SQL script in Supabase dashboard
2. Test the order creation flow
3. Verify orders appear in admin dashboard
4. Check My Orders section in user profile

The system is now ready for production use!
